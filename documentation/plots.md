# Ouput

The main output of the pipeline is a plot that shows the fraction of the population belonging to each of the two reference sequences for each position of the genome. On top of this, a black line, representing the fraction of breakpoints recorded at each position, is present. The plot is created for each timestep at which the population was analyzed.

This is an example:

This plot is the sum of the two plots described below.

## Coverage plot

After gathering the inference carried out on all reads, for each site of the hybrid reference the fraction of reads assigned to ancestral sequence 1 and 2 is plotted.

Example:


## Recombination plot

After gathering the inference carried out on all reads, all the recombination events (i.e. position of a recombinant read where it is inferred the switch from a reference to the other) are plotted on the hybrid reference genome, normalised for the total amount of reads mapped on each position.

Example:

## hyperparameter optimization

The pipeline can also perform the optimization of the hyperparameter Î¸, corresponding to the recombination frequency in the dataset. The optimization is carried out by maximum likelihood, for details see [here](scripts.md)
