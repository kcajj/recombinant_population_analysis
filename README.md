# recombinant_population_analysis

This repository deals with data produced by Aionostat, a machine that allows automatic experimental evolution of phages. In particular, we will use data generated by an experiment in which multiple phages were co-infecting a bacteria and ended up recombining between each other.

The whole population of phages was sequenced. This repository aims at:
1. defining a method to identify recombinant reads
2. give a comprehensive representation of the recombination events happening in the population
